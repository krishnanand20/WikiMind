A: Santi Bartolomeo ed Alessandro dei Bergamaschi (Saints Bartholomew the Apostle and Alexander of Bergamo of the people of Bergamo) is a little church in Piazza Colonna in Rome, Italy, next to Palazzo Wedekind.  Originally it was named Santa Maria della Pietà, from the high relief over the door. The present Santa Maria della Pietà in Rome is in Vatican City.
In its origins (1591) the church was the chapel erected by padre Ferrante Ruiz for the Ospedale dei Pazzarelli, Rome's first insane asylum. When this was moved to Via della Lungara in the 1720s, the church was given over to the Archiconfraternità dei Bergamaschi, who rebuilt it in 1731–35 to designs of Giuseppe Valvassori, added their patron saint to its dedication and used the hospital for their own sick.  It is the burial place of Cardinal Giuseppe Alessandro Furietti, antiquarian and native of Bergamo.
It is looked after by the Arciconfraternità, a historic association of Bergamaschi living in Rome that was begun in 1539.  It supports understanding of the culture, the values and the traditions of Bergamo and their fertile dialogue with those of Rome.
The Church hosted a painting of the Seven Archangels whose names had been scratched out by order of Cardinal Albizzi.

Q: What is geometric measure theory?
A: In geometric measure theory an approximate tangent space is a measure theoretic generalization of the concept of a tangent space for a differentiable manifold.

Q: What is a tangent space?
A: In differential geometry the defining characteristic of a tangent space is that it approximates the smooth manifold to first order near the point of tangency. Equivalently, if we zoom in more and more at the point of tangency the manifold appears to become more and more straight, asymptotically tending to approach the tangent space. This turns out to be the correct point of view in geometric measure theory.

Q: What is the Fis Phenomenon?
A: The Fis Phenomenon is a phenomenon during a child's language acquisition that demonstrates that perception of phonemes occurs earlier than a child's ability to produce the appropriate allophone. It is also illustrative of a larger theme in child language acquisition: that skills in linguistic comprehension generally precede corresponding skills in linguistic production. The name comes from an incident reported in 1960 by J. Berko and R. Brown, in which a child referred to his inflatable plastic fish as a fis. However, when adults asked him, "Is this your fis?" he rejected the statement. When he was asked, "Is this your fish?" he responded, "Yes, my fis." This shows that although the child could not produce the phoneme /ʃ/, he could perceive it as being different from the phoneme /s/. In some cases, the sounds produced by the child are actually acoustically different, but not significantly enough for others to distinguish since the language in question does not make such contrasts.

The observer saw what Juli had signed, thinking that Juli wanted to eat the rocks in her hand and commented to Juli that she couldn't eat rocks. Juli responded with the appropriate handshape for water.

Though best known for its history as a boxing venue, the Valley Arena also hosted wrestling, basketball, roller hockey, miniature golf and featured its own restaurant. As a nightclub and theatre in the round venue it also hosted an array of vaudeville acts such as The Three Stooges and Bela Lugosi, as well as renowned musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, The Ink Spots, The Dorsey Brothers, The Glenn Miller Orchestra, Sarah Vaughan, and The Temptations. In an interview with Woody Herman and band alumni, Jack Dulong, saxophonist and member of Herman's "Third Herd", described it as "an 'institution' for big bands."
Plagued by several fires, at least one of which was from suspected arson, as well as a decline in attendance with the emergence of television, the venue was closed following the 3rd such fire on May 12, 1960. After considerable delay, the building was ultimately demolished in August 1964.

Q: What is the Black-and-chestnut eagle?
A: The Black-and-chestnut eagle is a large South American species of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It is often placed in the monotypic genus Oroaetus. However, recent genetic testing indicates that this species is fairly closely related to Spizaetus species and thus the species should be included in that genus. The black-and-chestnut eagle is a typical forest raptor, hunting primarily small to medium-sized mammals and birds and constructing a large nest in a tall tree. Unfortunately, the twin causes of habitat destruction and persecution, justified or not as an occasional poultry killer, have caused strong population declines and the black-and-chestnut eagle is considered to be an Endangered species by the IUCN.

Q: What is Artificial Intelligence?
A: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It is a field of study and development that aims to build computer programs capable of exhibiting intelligent behavior such as reasoning, planning, learning, and natural language processing. AI is often used to describe software or machines that are able to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. However, researchers argue that the term AI should not be used to describe machines that simply carry out instructions given to them by humans, which is often referred to as "weak AI". Some experts predict that AI will have a profound impact on society, transforming many aspects of life, including commerce, medicine, education, and warfare. Experts also predict that AI could potentially pose a risk to society and the environment, as it may develop to a point where it is more intelligent than humans.

Q: What is Cannabigerol (CBG)?
A: Cannabigerol (CBG) is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid and minor constituent of cannabis. It is one of more than 120 identified cannabinoids found in the plant genus Cannabis. The compound is the decarboxylated form of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), the parent molecule from which other cannabinoids are biosynthesized.
During plant growth, most of the CBG is converted into other cannabinoids, primarily tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD), leaving about 1% CBG in the plant. Some strains, however, produce larger amounts of CBG and CBGA, while having low quantities of other cannabinoids, like THC and CBD.
The pharmacodynamics of CBG are complex. It is a relatively weak ligand of the cannabinoid receptors, where it acts as a weak partial agonist. Conversely, it is a much more potent agonist of the α2-adrenergic receptor, antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, and antagonist of the transient receptor potential channel TRPM8. CBG also has a variety of other actions that may additionally contribute to its effects.
Although CBG is sold as a dietary supplement, its effects and safety for human consumption are unknown. Safety concerns have been raised due to the potent activation of α2-adrenergic receptors by CBG, which may produce sedation and potentially undesirable cardiovascular effects like decreased heart rate and blood pressure.

Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of CBG have not been extensively studied. CBG is only weakly bound to plasma proteins (less than 1%) and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 1–2 hours. The plasma half-life is around 2 hours.
After oral administration, CBG is metabolized by the liver into 3 active metabolites: 10-hydroxy-cannabigerol (10-OH-CBG), 11-hydroxy-cannabigerol (11-OH-CBG), and 11-nor-9-carboxy-cannabigerol (CBCG). 10-OH-CBG is the most abundant metabolite, accounting for between 20–40% of the total administered dose of CBG. 11-OH-C

Q: What is wraparound?
A: The wraparound process is an intensive, individualized care management process for youths with serious or complex needs. Wraparound was initially developed in the 1980s as a means for maintaining youth with the most serious emotional and behavioral problems in their home and community. During the wraparound process, a team of individuals who are relevant to the well-being of the child or youth (e.g., family members, other natural supports, service providers, and agency representatives) collaboratively develop an individualized plan of care, implement this plan, and evaluate success over time. The wraparound plan typically includes formal services and interventions, together with community services and interpersonal support and assistance provided by friends, kin, and other people drawn from the family's social networks. The team convenes frequently to measure the plan's components against relevant indicators of success. Plan components and strategies are revised when outcomes are not being achieved.
The process of engaging the family, convening the team, developing the plan, implementing the plan, and transitioning the youth out of formal wraparound is typically facilitated by a trained care manager or “wraparound facilitator,” sometimes with the assistance of a family support worker. The wraparound process, and the plan itself, is designed to be culturally competent, strengths based, and organized around family members’ own perceptions of needs, goals, and likelihood of success.

Q: What is a Quark?
A: A quark is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. All commonly observable matter is composed of up quarks, down quarks and electrons. Owing to a phenomenon known as color confinement, quarks are never found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, which include baryons (such as protons and neutrons) and mesons, or in quark–gluon plasmas. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of hadrons.
    There are six types, known as flavors, of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a

Q: What is Billie Jenkins?
A: Billie Jenkins is a fictional character who appeared in the American television supernatural drama Charmed, which aired on The WB from 1998 to 2006. The character was created by executive producer Brad Kern and was portrayed by Kaley Cuoco. Billie was developed in response to The WB's request for a new character, and was intended to expand the show in a new direction for a possible ninth season or a spin-off series, leading to mixed opinions of media outlets.
Billie was introduced as a novice witch seeking training from the series' protagonists Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs), Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano), and Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). Her storylines focus on her search for her missing sister Christy Jenkins (Marnette Patterson) and their eventual reunion. She gains the ability to warp reality through the power of projection and is revealed as the "Ultimate Power". Christy and the demonic council known as the Triad manipulates Billie into believing the Charmed Ones are corrupted by their powers but when the truth is revealed, she eventually reconnects with the Halliwells. The character also makes further canonical appearances in the comic books Charmed: Season 9 and Charmed: Season 10 as a friend to the sisters and is referenced in one of the novels.
Critical response to Billie was mixed; some critics felt that she was a strong addition to Charmed while others cited Cuoco's acting and the character's story arc with Christy as signs of the show's declining quality.

It consists of a sheer and barren rock with three high peaks, the highest being the 300 m (980 ft) Cerro de la Mona. The island is about 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) in length from northeast to southwest, and 640 metres (700 yards) across at its widest.

Geography
Malpelo is the only island that rises above the surface from the Malpelo Ridge, which is a solitary volcanic submarine ridge that extends in a northeast-southwest direction for 300 km (190 mi) and has a width of 100 km (62 mi). This island is surrounded by a number of offshore rocks. Off the northeast corner are the Tres Mosqueteros. Off the southwest corner are Salomón, Saúl, La Gringa, and Escuba. All the rocks are surrounded by deep water, and most of the face of the main island is very steep. Soundings  between 1,800 and 9,100 metres (1,000 and 5,000 fathoms) are obtainable within a few kilometres of the shore and the currents are strong and changeable. As an oceanic island, it has never been connected with any other islands or the mainland.
Malpelo Island is composed of Miocene pillow lavas, volcanic breccias, and basaltic dikes that have been dated as being 16 to 17 million years old. This island and the underlying and underwater Malpelo Ridge were created along with the Carnegie Ridge in the Late Miocene by a very complex interaction of

Q: What is the Well of Loneliness about?
A: The Well of Loneliness is a lesbian novel by British author Radclyffe Hall that was first published in 1928 by Jonathan Cape. It follows the life of Stephen Gordon, an Englishwoman from an upper-class family whose "sexual inversion" (homosexuality) is apparent from an early age. She finds love with Mary Llewellyn, whom she meets while serving as an ambulance driver during the First World War, but their happiness together is marred by social isolation and rejection, which Hall depicts as the typical sufferings of "inverts", with predictably debilitating effects. The novel portrays "inversion" as a natural, God-given state and makes an explicit plea: "Give us also the right to our existence".
    Shortly after the book's publication, it became the target of a campaign by James Douglas, editor of the Sunday Express. Douglas wrote that "I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel." A British court judged it obscene because it defended "unnatural practices between women"; not until 1949, twenty years later, was it again published in England. In the United States, the book survived legal challenges in New York state and in Customs Court.
    Publicity over The Well of Loneliness's legal battles increased the visibility of lesbians in British and American culture. For decades it was the best-known lesbian novel in English, and often the first source of information about lesbianism that young people could find. Some readers have valued it, while others dismiss it as a "vicious and misogynistic" work.
