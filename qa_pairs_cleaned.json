Originally it was named Santa Maria della Pietà, from the high relief over the door. The present Santa Maria della Pietà in Rome is in Vatican City.\nIn its origins (1591) the church was the chapel erected by padre Ferrante Ruiz for the Ospedale dei Pazzarelli, Rome's first insane asylum. When this was moved to Via della Lungara in the 1720s, the church was given over to the Archiconfraternità dei Bergamaschi, who rebuilt it in 1731–35 to designs of Giuseppe Valvassori, added their patron saint to its dedication and used the hospital for their own sick.  It is the burial place of Cardinal Giuseppe Alessandro Furietti, antiquarian and native of Bergamo.\nIt is looked after by the Arciconfraternità, a historic association of Bergamaschi living in Rome that was begun in 1539.  It supports understanding of the culture, the values and the traditions of Bergamo and their fertile dialogue with those of Rome.\nThe Church hosted a painting of the Seven Archangels whose names had been scratched out by order of Cardinal Albizzi.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nTouring Club Italiano (TCI), Roma e Dintorni 1962:175."

        "qa_pairs": "Q: What is the Fis Phenomenon?\n    A: The Fis Phenomenon is a phenomenon during a child's language acquisition that demonstrates that perception of phonemes occurs earlier than a child's ability to produce the appropriate allophone. It is also illustrative of a larger theme in child language acquisition: that skills in linguistic comprehension generally precede corresponding skills in linguistic production. The name comes from an incident reported in 1960 by J. Berko and R. Brown, in which a child referred to his inflatable plastic fish as a fis. However, when adults asked him, \"Is this your fis?\" he rejected the statement. When he was asked, \"Is this your fish?\" he responded, \"Yes, my fis.\" This shows that although the child could not produce the phoneme /ʃ/, he could perceive it as being different from the phoneme /s/. In some cases, the sounds produced by the child are actually acoustically different, but not significantly enough for others to distinguish since the language in question does not make such contrasts.\n\nQ: What does the Fis Phenomenon illustrate about child language acquisition?\nA: The Fis Phenomenon illustrates that skills in linguistic comprehension generally precede corresponding skills in linguistic production.\n\nQ: Why did the researchers see the Fis Phenomenon occur while doing research on Juli, a toddler who speaks ASL?\nA: The observers had seen it occur with her use of the word for 'water' when Juli was outside holding rocks in her hand and speaking to the observer through a window. Juli produced the sign [ix-rock water ix-loc(hose)] with the \"20\" handshape error for \"water\". The observer saw what Juli had signed, thinking that Juli wanted to eat the rocks in her hand and commented to Juli that she couldn't eat rocks. Juli responded with the appropriate handshape for water.\n\nQ: What did the observers see when Juli was holding rocks outside and speaking to them through a window?\nA: Juli produced the sign [ix-rock water ix-loc(hose)] with the \"20\" handshape error for \"water\"."

Though best known for its history as a boxing venue, the Valley Arena also hosted wrestling, basketball, roller hockey, miniature golf and featured its own restaurant. As a nightclub and theatre in the round venue it also hosted an array of vaudeville acts such as The Three Stooges and Bela Lugosi, as well as renowned musicians including Count Basie, Duke Ellington, The Ink Spots, The Dorsey Brothers, The Glenn Miller Orchestra, Sarah Vaughan, and The Temptations. In an interview with Woody Herman and band alumni, Jack Dulong, saxophonist and member of Herman's \"Third Herd\", described it as \"an 'institution' for big bands.\"\nPlagued by several fires, at least one of which was from suspected arson, as well as a decline in attendance with the emergence of television, the venue was closed following the 3rd such fire on May 12, 1960. After considerable delay, the building was ultimately demolished in August 1964.\nToday the space where it once stood is occupied by the Valley Arena Park, a small recreational green space managed by the city."

It is often placed in the monotypic genus Oroaetus. However, recent genetic testing indicates that this species is fairly closely related to Spizaetus species and thus the species should be included in that genus. The black-and-chestnut eagle is a typical forest raptor, hunting primarily small to medium-sized mammals and birds and constructing a large nest in a tall tree. Unfortunately, the twin causes of habitat destruction and persecution, justified or not as an occasional poultry killer, have caused strong population declines and the black-and-chestnut eagle is considered to be an Endangered species by the IUCN."

It is a field of study and development that aims to build computer programs capable of exhibiting intelligent behavior such as reasoning, planning, learning, and natural language processing. AI is often used to describe software or machines that are able to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. However, researchers argue that the term AI should not be used to describe machines that simply carry out instructions given to them by humans, which is often referred to as \"weak AI\". Some experts predict that AI will have a profound impact on society, transforming many aspects of life, including commerce, medicine, education, and warfare. Experts also predict that AI could potentially pose a risk to society and the environment, as it may develop to a point where it is more intelligent than humans."

Media stories often reference Harris, Klebold and the massacre whenever another school shooting occurs.\nThe impact of Columbine is felt not only in terms of school safety and popular culture, but it also raises worries about student rights violations and excessive use of force in law enforcement methods. The event demands a reevaluation of mental health advocacy and intervention tactics to avoid situations where a person becomes dangerous to themselves or others.

It is one of more than 120 identified cannabinoids found in the plant genus Cannabis. The compound is the decarboxylated form of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), the parent molecule from which other cannabinoids are biosynthesized.\nDuring plant growth, most of the CBG is converted into other cannabinoids, primarily tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD), leaving about 1% CBG in the plant. Some strains, however, produce larger amounts of CBG and CBGA, while having low quantities of other cannabinoids, like THC and CBD.\nThe pharmacodynamics of CBG are complex. It is a relatively weak ligand of the cannabinoid receptors, where it acts as a weak partial agonist. Conversely, it is a much more potent agonist of the α2-adrenergic receptor, antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, and antagonist of the transient receptor potential channel TRPM8. CBG also has a variety of other actions that may additionally contribute to its effects.\nAlthough CBG is sold as a dietary supplement, its effects and safety for human consumption are unknown. Safety concerns have been raised due to the potent activation of α2-adrenergic receptors by CBG, which may produce sedation and potentially undesirable cardiovascular effects like decreased heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nPharmacokinetics\nPharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of CBG have not been extensively studied. CBG is only weakly bound to plasma proteins (less than 1%) and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 1–2 hours. The plasma half-life is around 2 hours.\nAfter oral administration, CBG is metabolized by the liver into 3 active metabolites: 10-hydroxy-cannabigerol (10-OH-CBG), 11-hydroxy-cannabigerol (11-OH-CBG), and 11-nor-9-carboxy-cannabigerol (CBCG). 10-OH-CBG is the most abundant metabolite, accounting for between 20–40% of the total administered dose of CBG. 11-OH-C"

Wraparound was initially developed in the 1980s as a means for maintaining youth with the most serious emotional and behavioral problems in their home and community. During the wraparound process, a team of individuals who are relevant to the well-being of the child or youth (e.g., family members, other natural supports, service providers, and agency representatives) collaboratively develop an individualized plan of care, implement this plan, and evaluate success over time. The wraparound plan typically includes formal services and interventions, together with community services and interpersonal support and assistance provided by friends, kin, and other people drawn from the family's social networks. The team convenes frequently to measure the plan's components against relevant indicators of success. Plan components and strategies are revised when outcomes are not being achieved.\nThe process of engaging the family, convening the team, developing the plan, implementing the plan, and transitioning the youth out of formal wraparound is typically facilitated by a trained care manager or “wraparound facilitator,” sometimes with the assistance of a family support worker. The wraparound process, and the plan itself, is designed to be culturally competent, strengths based, and organized around family members’ own perceptions of needs, goals, and likelihood of success."

Peter Kerr started the gardens in 1916 on a 13-acre (5.3 ha) estate that passed to the Episcopal Diocese of Oregon after his death in 1957. The private estate includes a manor house-inspired residence and other structures, and is open to visitors Monday - Friday, 8:00 am – 5:00pm.\n\nMagnolias and other native and non-native trees, shrubs, and plants grow in the gardens. Dunthorpe is an unincorporated community on the west side of the Willamette south of Portland and north of Lake Oswego along Oregon Route 43.\n\nHistory\nKerr moved to Portland from Scotland in 1888 and started a grain business. He and his brother and Kerr's business partner bought land on the hillside in the early 1890s. They built a cottage on the site and lived there until the other two men married and moved elsewhere. Kerr, the sole remaining occupant, married Laurie King in 1905. They lived in the cottage until 1916, when a new house resembling a Scottish manor was completed on the site. John Olmsted of the Olmsted Brothers landscape architects, sited the house to provide a view of Mount Hood. After the manor was finished, Kerr, encouraged by his wife, began work on a large garden. Kerr planted the garden with plants obtained during his travels, as well as native Northwest plants. He spent nearly six decades developing the garden prior to his death at the age of 99."

Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. All commonly observable matter is composed of up quarks, down quarks and electrons. Owing to a phenomenon known as color confinement, quarks are never found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, which include baryons (such as protons and neutrons) and mesons, or in quark–gluon plasmas. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of hadrons.\n    There are six types, known as flavors, of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a"

The character was created by executive producer Brad Kern and was portrayed by Kaley Cuoco. Billie was developed in response to The WB's request for a new character, and was intended to expand the show in a new direction for a possible ninth season or a spin-off series, leading to mixed opinions of media outlets.\nBillie was introduced as a novice witch seeking training from the series' protagonists Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs), Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano), and Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan). Her storylines focus on her search for her missing sister Christy Jenkins (Marnette Patterson) and their eventual reunion. She gains the ability to warp reality through the power of projection and is revealed as the \"Ultimate Power\". Christy and the demonic council known as the Triad manipulates Billie into believing the Charmed Ones are corrupted by their powers but when the truth is revealed, she eventually reconnects with the Halliwells. The character also makes further canonical appearances in the comic books Charmed: Season 9 and Charmed: Season 10 as a friend to the sisters and is referenced in one of the novels.\nCritical response to Billie was mixed; some critics felt that she was a strong addition to Charmed while others cited Cuoco's acting and the character's story arc with Christy as signs of the show's declining quality."

The island is about 1.5 kilometres (1 mile) in length from northeast to southwest, and 640 metres (700 yards) across at its widest.\n\nGeography\nMalpelo is the only island that rises above the surface from the Malpelo Ridge, which is a solitary volcanic submarine ridge that extends in a northeast-southwest direction for 300 km (190 mi) and has a width of 100 km (62 mi). This island is surrounded by a number of offshore rocks. Off the northeast corner are the Tres Mosqueteros. Off the southwest corner are Salomón, Saúl, La Gringa, and Escuba. All the rocks are surrounded by deep water, and most of the face of the main island is very steep.

        "qa_pairs": "Q: What is the Well of Loneliness about?\n    A: The Well of Loneliness is a lesbian novel by British author Radclyffe Hall that was first published in 1928 by Jonathan Cape. It follows the life of Stephen Gordon, an Englishwoman from an upper-class family whose \"sexual inversion\" (homosexuality) is apparent from an early age. She finds love with Mary Llewellyn, whom she meets while serving as an ambulance driver during the First World War, but their happiness together is marred by social isolation and rejection, which Hall depicts as the typical sufferings of \"inverts\", with predictably debilitating effects. The novel portrays \"inversion\" as a natural, God-given state and makes an explicit plea: \"Give us also the right to our existence\".\n    Shortly after the book's publication, it became the target of a campaign by James Douglas, editor of the Sunday Express. Douglas wrote that \"I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel.\" A British court judged it obscene because it defended \"unnatural practices between women\"; not until 1949, twenty years later, was it again published in England. In the United States, the book survived legal challenges in New York state and in Customs Court.\n    Publicity over The Well of Loneliness's legal battles increased the visibility of lesbians in British and American culture. For decades it was the best-known lesbian novel in English, and often the first source of information about lesbianism that young people could find. Some readers have valued it, while others dismiss it as a \"vicious and misogynistic\" work."
